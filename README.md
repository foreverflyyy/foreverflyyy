# About me
Hi there! I'm Nikita, a passionate developer who loves building things with code. As a computer science student, I was always interested in learning everything I could about tech, from code and cloud to AI and machine learning.

My interest in code began with a dream to automate everything, but soon I found myself drawn to building web applications with React and TypeScript.

Whether it's developing a new product, improving an existing one, or optimizing processes, I'm excited to use my diverse skill set to drive growth and success.
